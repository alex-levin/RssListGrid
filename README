This Eclipse project shows how to use the DataSource with the Smart GWT free LGPL edition. It is based on the Smart GWT Enterprise Rss ListGrid showcase demo available at http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwtee/showcase/#data_integration_server_rss. The project does not depend on a server-side proxy for accessing a remote RSS feed available only in the Professional, Power, and Enterprsie Editions of Smart GWT.
