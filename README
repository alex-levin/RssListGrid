This Eclipse project shows how to use the DataSource with the Smart GWT LGPL free edition. It is based on the SmartGWT Enterprise Rss ListGrid showcase demo available at http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwtee/showcase/#data_integration_server_rss. The project does not depend on a server-side proxy for accessing a remote RSS feed available only in the Professional, Power, and Enterprsie Editions of Smart GWT.
